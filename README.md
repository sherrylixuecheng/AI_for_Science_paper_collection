# AI for Science paper collection

This is a new initiative by [AI for Science Community](https://ai4sciencecommunity.github.io/) to collect papers published in AI for Science areas and categorize them by subjects, years, venues and keywords, etc. 

Each `.csv` file contains the correponding list of each year. Currently, the paper list is labelled by keys of `Title`, `Conference`, `Type`, `Application`, `MLTech`, `OpenReviewLink`. One could visulalize the list directly on this GitHub repo or by `pandas`. 

## Covered venues

## Contribution guideline
We are gradually adding the results from past top conferences and welcome volunteers to contribute to this page!
You could contribute to this page by creating a PR on (1) updating a current `.csv` (2) contributing a new `.csv` for an uncovered conference/year
